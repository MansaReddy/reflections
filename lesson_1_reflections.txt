How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

You can always go back to the previous version and compare it with the latest
one to see where you made a mistake.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

git log will allow me to see all of the versions of my commits. Git Diff will
allow me to see the changes i made from one commit to another.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

Everything is in an organized manner and you can focus on a particular commit
without affecting other versions.
