What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
so that git knows where my files are.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
repository is the where different commits exist. Working directory is the live
site. It seperates beta version from live/active version of the project.
